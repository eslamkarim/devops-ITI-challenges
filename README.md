## DevOps Challenges for ITI students:
My solution for this challenge is on this [repo](https://github.com/eslamkarim/DevOps-Challenge-Demo-Code)

This repo contains tasks for students in Information Technology Institute (ITI).

The base code we will use to do most of the tasks can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/MohamedMSaeed/DevOps-Challenge-Demo-Code)

Fork the code repo and finish you task.

Good Luck!
